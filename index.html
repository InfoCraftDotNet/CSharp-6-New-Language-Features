<p>I've been developing a series of talks highlighting the new features in C# 6. If you've been to one of these talks, thanks! You're welcome to grab the slides and source here. Also, I have a series of blog posts <a href="http://www.infocraft.net/tag/new-features/">here</a> that focuses on expanding on the specific areas of C# 6 that I use on a daily basis.</p>
        <h2> Abstract</h2>
        <p>Visual Studio released in the summer of 2015, and with it came C# 6. Joe will be reviewing some of the new language features. In addition, you will get to see how those features work, not just in the latest version of .Net (4.6), but in prior versions. Finally, Joe will try to help you determine which features you should focus on adopting immediately, and which ones you can gradually adopt, as the need arises.<br />
          <br />
          The session will loosely follow a series of blog posts currently being written at <a href="http://www.infocraft.net/tag/new-features/" target="_blank">Joe’s website.</a></p>
        <h2>About Joe</h2>
        <p>Joseph earned his Master of Science in Information Technology, with a focus in Software Architecture from Capella University in 2009.<br/>
            <br />
          With a Bachelor in Psychology, a Master’s in IT, and graduate work in Technical Communications, Joe offers a unique variety of C# and app development expertise.
